HypPy Overview

Hyperspectral Python (HypPy) is a collection of tools developed at the University of Twente. HypPy has adopted the ENVI file format as the image format.

    Viewer for ENVI format hyperspectral images.
    Viewer for spectra and spectral libraries.
    Conversion programs.
    Simple spectral tools.
    Band Math.
    Spectral Math.
    Minimum Wavelength mapping.
    Destriping
    PCA and inverse PCA.
    Hyperspectral filters.
    Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM).
    Rule image classifier.
    Linear Unmixing (fully constrained).
    Tools for processing Omega images from the Mars Express.
    Command-line interface for scripting.
    Manuals:
        graphical user-interface
        scripting with HypPy

        spectral math 

HypPy Prerequisites

In order to run, HypPy needs Python3 plus additional modules. These can be picked up by installing the following packages:

    Python
    NumPy
    SciPy
    PIL/Pillow (Python imaging libary)
    Matplotlib
    Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit (optional, only needed for viewing shapefiles)
    OWSlib (optional, needed for WMS get)
    colour-science (optional, for colour science calculations)
    PySptools (for Linear Unmixing)
    pyproj (for conversion to KML) 
    netCDF4 (for conversion of EMIT data)

Installers for these packages can be found at the pages listed under the quick links menu.
HypPy Download

HypPy3 has been ported to Python3 and current development and bug-fixes are only continued on the HypPy3 version.

The following packages are needed on Linux:

    python3
    python3-tk
    python3-numpy
    python3-scipy
    python3-pil
    python3-pil.imagetk
    python3-matplotlib
    python3-mpltoolkits.basemap
    python3-owslib
    pip install colour-science
    pip install pysptools
    pip install pyproj 
    pip install netCDF4

Since there's no regular installer yet, the next best thing you can do is to create a new directory for HypPy and to unpack the tar file into this directory:

$ cd
$ mkdir HypPy
$ cd HypPy
$ tar zxvf ../hyppy.tar.gz
$ python tkHypPy.pyw
HypPy Installation, Windows

The easiest way to run HypPy on Windows is to pick up a Portable Python, for instance WinPython. WinPython is a complete portable scientific Python 3 distribution for Windows.

In the download directory above /a minimal winpython with hyppy/ is provided. Read the readme file for instructions. If you prefer to download winpython and hyppy yourself, please continue reading.

Download the latest WinPython with Python 3 and extract the package into a directory. This may be any directory of your choice; that's why it's called a portable Python.

From the WinPython directory run the WinPython control panel.exe. Go to the Advanced tab and Register your WinPython.

There is no uninstall for WinPython. Should you want to get rid of the WinPython then you can do that by simply unregistering first using the WinPython control panel and then to delete the entire WinPython directory tree.

Alternatively, you can install Python 3 and all the required packages yourself.

Next, download the HypPy3 zip file. Create a directory for HypPy. Unzip the hyppy3.zip into this directory.

To start HypPy go to the HypPy directory and double-click the tkHypPy.pyw. The HypPy main menu will pop up in the upper-right corner.

(If you need installers for 64-bit Windows systems, these can be found at this site maintained by Christoph Gohlke.)

(Tip: if Python installers hang on Windows you can trying running the installer as administrator; right-click the installer and click Run as administrator.)
HypPy Installation, other systems

Install Python 3 plus packages

Pick up the zip file, create a directory HypPy, unzip the hyppy.zip into this directory. To run HypPy double-click the file tkHypPy.pyw.

HypPy Documentation

The documentation of HypPy is contained by the code. The documentation is split into three levels:

1. The User Manual for the graphical user-interface (GUI). 
2. The Scripting Manual for the conmmandline-interface (CLI). 
3. The Programming Manual for Pythonites.

As the package is in development, the documentation is never really finished. But I think the documentation is at least 90% complete.

HypPy Contact

HypPy is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GNU-GPL). We don't claim that this software is fit for any purpose. HypPy does have its limitations in the sense that the file size on 32-bit systems is limited to 2 GB (no limits on 64-bit systems) and that the display program was not designed to handle huge images. However, if you find HypPy useful, or if you have comments or contributions, please, send us an e-mail.

If you produce any scientific output using HypPy, please consider citing the references mentioned below.
